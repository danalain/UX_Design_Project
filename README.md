## Background

Third-Gear is a tech company in the state of California with an expanding workforce. It has developed a simple web-development application that lets users without any coding experience to create applications. With unparalleled speed and efficiency, the Third-Gear web-development application had increased its user base to 300 million in the global market as of 2020. 

The company wants to integrate self-service e-learning courses that their employees will use for their learning activities. However, the expanding workforce presents a problem with inefficiencies in its current Learning Management System (LMS). 

Now, Third-Gear has come to Lain Consulting Company to get better ideas and design for Third-Gear LMS.

### Overview

Current Third-Gear's LMS presents us with the opportunity to improve user experience substantially. The objective of Lain Consulting is to create a fully optimized LMS design to drive engagement and satisfaction with the self-service e-learning courses. 

### Idea Process

To get an idea of where the LMS design should go, we came up with 4 questions to access the situation.

1. How much time do people spend looking for training?

> This will lead us to design an interface that will accommodate the attention span of an average user.

2. How easily can the users search for relevant pieces of training based on their positions and career goals?

> This will lead us to think about a design that will provide personalization.

3. How many people are using the search function?

> This is a reliable metric to access the success of the solution.

4. What are the current LMS's completion rates for the training?

> This is a reliable metric to compare the completion rate before and after the implementation of the new LMS system.

### Solution Overview

#### Solution 

Design a user interface with better choice architecture.

#### Strategies

For an effective choice architecture, we recommend using the following strategies.

* __Strategy 1__: Feature trending training based on top content views.
* __Strategy 2__: Recommend training based on search history.
* __Strategy 3__: Streamline the Library Catalog.

### Metrics and Concepts

1. Trending Training Tab: A Sense of Community

> People are drawn to popular content because it produces a sense of belonging. The trending videos will provide the employees with a sense of community.

2. Recommend Training Tab: Personalization of Courses

> Using the search history of users, the platform can provide a personalized set of videos under the recommended training tab. 

3. Library Catalog Tab: A Design for Relevancy

> The library catalog categorizes videos based on the teams. It will provide the users with the most relevant courses possible based on the selection.

### Product Recommendation

1. Trending Training Tab: A fun way to show that there is a community behind the LMS platform to increase user engagement and satisfaction.

2. Recommended Training Tab: A personalized set of videos based on the user’s profile and search history. User experience will improve because the users won’t have to make decisions on what the best videos are for them.

3. Library Catalog: Users can view videos based on what teams they belong to with one click into one of the given options.

### Conclusion

As the e-learning industry is changing, companies are moving towards a self-service e-learning strategy. 

Therefore, it is important to have an LMS platform that provides tools with training resources that are personal and easily available for employees to follow through to drive the engagement. 

By implementing the three strategies, there is a likelihood of an increase in user experience that will drive engagement and satisfaction.
